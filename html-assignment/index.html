        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Shahr Bano and I'm currently a student at <abbr title="Algonquine College">AC</abbr>.
            I'm passionate about learning web development and enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            My goal is to become a full stack developer. I love exploring new technologies and building projects that solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I love to learn new things. Since I have started my new journey in the IMD program, I try to spend extra time practicing each course especially Web Design and Digital Graphic, which require more practice.
            I believe that <em>consistent practce</em> is the key to mastering any skill, and it is important for developing <sup>21st</sup> century skills.
